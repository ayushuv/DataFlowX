# Installation and Enviornment Setup

To set up a local environment for developing a data analytics pipeline using Amazon Data Migration Services (DMS), you'll need to install and configure several components. Below are the general steps you would typically follow:

- ## Install Required Software:

    - AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your computer. You can download and install it from the official AWS   CLI website: AWS CLI.
    - Python: AWS services are often interacted with using Python scripts. Ensure Python is installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: Python.
    - AWS SDKs: Depending on your programming language preferences, you might need to install AWS SDKs for languages such as Boto3 for Python or AWS SDK for Java.
    - Database Clients: Install any necessary database clients if you're working with specific databases. For example, if you're using MySQL or PostgreSQL databases, you might need to install MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin.
      
    ## Linux
    - You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package. If your operating system doesn't have the built-in unzip command, use an equivalent.
    - The AWS CLI uses glibc, groff, and less. These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.
    - We support the AWS CLI on 64-bit versions of recent distributions of CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and Linux ARM.
    - Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories, we canâ€™t guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.

    ### Warning
    If this is your first time updating on Amazon Linux, to install the latest version of the AWS CLI, you must uninstall the pre-installed yum version using the following     command:

      $ sudo yum remove awscli
    - After the yum installation of the AWS CLI is removed, follow the below Linux install instructions.

    - To install the AWS CLI, run the following commands.

            $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
            unzip awscliv2.zip
            sudo ./aws/install
    - To update your current installation of the AWS CLI, add your existing symlink and installer information to construct the install command using the --bin-dir, --            install-dir, and --update parameters. The following command block uses an example symlink of /usr/local/bin and example installer location of /usr/local/aws-cli.

            $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
            unzip awscliv2.zip
            sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update

    ## macOS
    - In your browser, download the macOS pkg file: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg
    - Run your downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. You can choose to install the AWS CLI in the following ways:
    - For all users on the computer (requires sudo)
        - You can install to any folder, or choose the recommended default folder of /usr/local/aws-cli.
        - The installer automatically creates a symlink at /usr/local/bin/aws that links to the main program in the installation folder you chose.
    - For only the current user (doesn't require sudo)
        - You can install to any folder to which you have write permission.
        - Due to standard user permissions, after the installer finishes, you must manually create a symlink file in your $PATH that points to the aws and aws_completer programs by using the following commands at the command prompt. If your $PATH includes a folder you can write to, you can run the following command without sudo if you specify that folder as the target's path. If you don't have a writable folder in your $PATH, you must use sudo in the commands to get permissions to write to the specified target folder. The default location for a symlink is /usr/local/bin/.

                $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws /usr/local/bin/aws
                $ sudo ln -s /folder/installed/aws-cli/aws_completer /usr/local/bin/aws_completer
    ### Note
    You can view debug logs for the installation by pressing Cmd+L anywhere in the installer. This opens a log pane that enables you to filter and save the log. The log file is also automatically saved to /var/log/install.log.

    - To verify that the shell can find and run the aws command in your $PATH, use the following commands.


            $ which aws
            /usr/local/bin/aws 
            $ aws --version
            aws-cli/2.15.19 Python/3.11.6 Darwin/23.3.0 botocore/2.4.5

    ## Windows
    - Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit): https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

    Alternatively, you can run the msiexec command to run the MSI installer.

            C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
    - For various parameters that can be used with msiexec, see msiexec on the Microsoft Docs website. For example, you can use the /qn flag for a silent installation.


            C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi /qn
    - To confirm the installation, open the Start menu, search for cmd to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the aws --version command.


            C:\> aws --version
            aws-cli/2.15.19 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off

    ## AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)

  Get started quickly using AWS with boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

        pip install boto3


    ## AWS CDK in Python

    Python is a fully-supported client language for the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and is considered stable. Working with the AWS CDK in Python uses familiar tools, including the standard Python implementation (CPython), virtual environments with virtualenv, and the Python package installer pip. The modules comprising the AWS Construct Library are distributed via [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/search/?q=aws-cdk). The Python version of the AWS CDK even uses Python-style identifiers (for example, snake_case method names).

        pip install aws-cdk.cdk

    Python AWS CDK applications require Python 3.6 or later. If you don't already have it installed, [download a compatible version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system at [python.org](https://www.python.org/). If you run Linux, your system may have come with a compatible version, or you may install it using your distro's package manager (yum, apt, etc.). Mac users may be interested in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a Linux-style package manager for macOS.

    The Python package installer, pip, and virtual environment manager, virtualenv, are also required. Windows installations of compatible Python versions include these tools. On Linux, pip and virtualenv may be provided as separate packages in your package manager. Alternatively, you may install them with the following commands:


        python -m ensurepip --upgrade
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv

    If you encounter a permission error, run the above commands with the --user flag so that the modules are installed in your user directory, or use sudo to obtain the permissions to install the modules system-wide.


- ## Configure AWS CLI:

Once installed, configure the AWS CLI with your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region, and output format. You can do this by running aws configure command in your terminal and following the prompts.

- ## Set Up Amazon DMS:

You won't be able to set up Amazon DMS locally, but you can configure replication tasks and endpoints through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to replicate data between AWS resources.
Ensure you have access to an AWS account where you can create and configure DMS instances, replication tasks, and endpoints.
- ## Development Environment:

Set up your preferred development environment. This could be an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any other editor you prefer.
- ## Install Dependencies:

If you're using Python, install necessary dependencies such as boto3 for interacting with AWS services, pandas for data manipulation, and any other libraries required for your specific tasks. You can install dependencies using pip, the Python package manager.
- ## Code Development:

Develop scripts or applications to interact with AWS services, retrieve data from source databases, and perform any necessary transformations or processing.
- ## Testing:

Test your scripts and applications locally to ensure they work as expected.
- ## Deployment:

Once your scripts are tested and ready, you can deploy them to AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, or other AWS resources as needed.
- ## Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging within your scripts to capture errors, warnings, and relevant information. You can also utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.


## Note
Keep in mind that while you can set up your development environment locally, the actual data migration and analytics processing will occur in the AWS cloud environment. Make sure to follow best practices for security, access control, and cost management when working with AWS services.
