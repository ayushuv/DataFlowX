# Cloud Migration

Cloud Migration is a transformation from old traditional business operations to digital business operations and the process refers to moving the digital business operations to cloud. That means data, applications or other business elements are moved into a cloud computing environment. For example moving a companyâ€™s digital assets, services, databases, IT resources, and applications either partially, or wholly, into the cloud.

Cloud migration is also about moving from one cloud to another.
